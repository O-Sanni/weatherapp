# Weather App

 ## Pseudocode

    create HomePage; in HomePage set up separate .states for daily temperature and weather image; create function to get daily tempature and image; use axios.get;
    create another three.js files, one will check if there information in my states and will be called inside dailyInfo.js and Image.js; DailyInfo will return night and day temperature and Image will return the image related to dayly weather; create hourly forecast .js file to show hourly forecast
    ; also create another .js file to return hourly information; create a Route component and Switch component to choose different pages; create separate components for hourly forecast; create .js file which will go our the hourly forecast for particular day and output the information on the page: save the value of all hourse together and then rander through the array and aoutput the values; 

    **Unfortunatelly I got stuck on hourly forecast, instead I did daily forecast for each part of NYC
